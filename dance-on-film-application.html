	<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">APPLICATION FAQS</h5>
			<h6>What genre of film are you accepting?</h6>
			<p>We are accepting films which highlight or incorporate dance performance and choreography. Cinematic design alongside central choreography themes should be used to reveal central themes of the film, whether these themes be connected to a narrative or story, states of being, or more experimental and formal concerns.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Is there a time limit?</h6>
			<p>Yes, 10 minutes maximum.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Can I submit more than one piece?</h6>
			<p>Yes, you may submit more than one piece, however please note that each application will require its own application fee.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Can my video submission be a work in progress? Does it have to be finished?</h6>
			<p>In order to apply you must submit a YouTube, Vimeo or Google Drive file version of your finished work. Please DO NOT send files via Dropbox; we will not be able to view these. Please do not send any raw footage - we'll need to view the film in its most final version in order to consider it for the festival.</p>
			<p>The film you submit cannot exceed 10 minutes. If you wish to use an excerpt from a longer film, please be prepared to have the excerpt edited and finalized by the application deadline. The more detailed notes you leave in your application  the better.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>How will I know if I’ve been selected?</h6>
			<p>All applicants will receive an email by the notification date. (If you do not receive an email by this time, please contact us directly.) If you are selected, you will be asked to promptly accept our invitation and send more specific information for your screening. If you do not meet our acceptance deadline, we will assume you are not interested in participating and will give your spot to another artist.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Do participants receive a stipend?</h6>
			<p>We are unable to provide artists with stipends this year.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Do you provide waivers for the $25 application fee?</h6>
			<p>No, we do not provide waivers for the $25 application fee.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Do I have to be present at the screening if I am from out of town?</h6>
			<p>No, you may submit a film to the festival even if you are unable to attend the screening. We’ll miss you, though!</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Will my film receive any feedback or critique?</h6>
			<p>The screening will include a program with information about the chosen pieces and artists. Audience members will vote for the three “Audience Favorite” awards.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>I’ve read through the guidelines and FAQs, and I still have a question!</h6>
