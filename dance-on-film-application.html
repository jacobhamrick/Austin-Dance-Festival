	<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">APPLICATION FAQS</h5>
		<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">What genre of film are you accepting?</span><br>
			We are accepting films which highlight or incorporate dance performance and choreography. Cinematic design alongside central choreography themes should be used to reveal central themes of the film, whether these themes be connected to a narrative or story, states of being, or more experimental and formal concerns.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Is there a time limit?</span><br>
			The film you submit cannot exceed 12 minutes. If you wish to use an excerpt from a longer film, please be prepared to have the excerpt edited and finalized by the application deadline. The more detailed notes you leave in your application  the better.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Can I submit more than one piece?</span><br>
			Yes, you may submit two pieces. But please note that each application will require its own application fee.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Can my video submission be a work in progress? Does it have to be finished?</span><br>
			In order to apply you must submit a YouTube, Vimeo or Google Drive file version of your work. We recognize this might mean you cannot upload the highest quality version of your film- that’s okay! We’ll work with your screening requirements if your film is accepted in order to project the best version of the piece. But please do not send raw footage- we’ll need to see a film as close to finished as possible in order to consider it for the festival.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">How will I know if I’ve been selected?</span><br>
			All applicants will receive an email by the notification date. (If you do not receive an email by this time, please contact us directly.) If you are selected, you will be asked to promptly accept our invitation and send more specific information for your screening. If you do not meet our acceptance deadline, we will assume you are not interested in participating and will give your spot to another artist.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Do participants receive a stipend?</span><br>
			We are unable to provide artists with stipends this year.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Do I have to be present at the screening if I am from out of town?</span><br>
			No, you may submit a film to the festival even if you are unable to attend the screening. We’ll miss you, though!<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">Will my film receive any feedback or critique?</span><br>
			The screening will include a program with information about the chosen pieces and artists. There will be an option for audience members to leave written feedback for each film, which you can then request from us.<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-weight:bold;">I’ve read through the guidelines and FAQs, and I still have a question!</span><br>
			No problem. Contact Lisa Kobdish: lisa.austindancefestival@gmail.com<br>
