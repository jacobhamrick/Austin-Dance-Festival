	<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">APPLICATION FAQS</h5>
			<h6>How do I apply?</h6>
			<p>The only way to apply to Dance on Film 2020 is via FilmFreeway, the world's #1 way to discover and submit to film festivals and creative contests. Please get acquainted with the submission site at <a href="https://filmfreeway.com/AustinDanceFestival" target="_blank">FilmFreeway.com</a>
			</p>
			<br>
			<h6>What genre of film are you accepting?</h6>
			<p>We are accepting films which highlight or incorporate dance performance and choreography. Cinematic design alongside central choreography themes should be used to reveal central themes of the film, whether these themes be connected to a narrative or story, states of being, or more experimental and formal concerns.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Is there a time limit?</h6>
			<p>Yes, 10 minutes maximum.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Can I submit more than one piece?</h6>
			<p>Yes, you may submit more than one piece. However, each piece will need to be submitted separately, and a separate application fee is required for each piece.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Can my video submission be a work in progress? Does it have to be finished?</h6>
			<p>In order to apply you must submit a YouTube, Vimeo or Google Drive file version of your finished work. Please DO NOT send files via Dropbox; we will not be able to view these. Please do not send any raw footage - we'll need to view the film in its final version in order to consider it for the festival.</p>
			<p>The film you submit cannot exceed 10 minutes. If you wish to use an excerpt from a longer film, please have an edited excerpt finalized by the application deadline. The more detailed notes you leave in your application the better.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h6>How will I know if I’ve been selected?</h6>
			<p>All applicants will receive an email by the notification date. (If you do not receive an email by this time, please contact us directly.) If you are selected, you will be asked to promptly accept our invitation and send more specific information for your screening. If you do not meet our acceptance deadline, we will assume you are not interested in participating and will give your spot to another artist.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Do participants receive a stipend?</h6>
			<p>We are unable to provide artists with stipends this year. However, as a chosen artist you will receive a complimentary ticket to Austin Dance Festival, which includes the Artist Reception, film screening, and all dance concerts.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Do you provide waivers for the application fees?</h6>
			<p>No, we do not provide waivers for the application fees.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Do I have to be present at the screening if I am from out of town?</h6>
			<p>No, you may submit a film to the festival even if you are unable to attend the screening or festival. We’ll miss you, though! If you are able to attend, you will have the opportunity to engage in a moderated Director's Chat on stage immediately following the screening.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>Will my film receive any feedback or critique?</h6>
			<p>The screening will include a published program with information about the chosen pieces and artists. Audience members will vote for the top three “Audience Favorite” awards, and we will provide each artist with a digital Dance on Film laurel (for "Audience Favorite" or "Official Selection"), which artists can use to promote their film to future presenters and audiences.</p>
			<br>
			<h6>I’ve read through the guidelines and FAQs, and I still have a question!</h6>
			<p>No problem. Contact Lisa Kobdish: <a href="mailto:LISA@AUSTINDANCEFESTIVAL.COM">LISA@AUSTINDANCEFESTIVAL.COM</a></p>
