	<br>
	<h5 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1rem;">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION BEFORE APPLYING</h5>
	<p><strong>Length of dances:</strong> Approximately 4-12 minutes. 18 min max.</p>
	<br>
	<p><strong>Footwear:</strong> Only bare feet or socks are allowed on the dance floor.</p>
		<br>
	<p><strong>Other:</strong> No helium balloons, confetti, glitter, nudity or profanity.</p>
		<br>
	<p><strong>Techs:</strong> In order to present 20 dance companies in one day, we forego traditional techs or dress rehearsals. Instead, artists answer an online questionnaire about lighting and music cues prior to arriving in Austin. Because we have so little time to rehearse in the theatre, lighting and music cues should be kept to a minimum. Choreographers with dances that rely heavily on specific and/or extensive lighting and sound cues will be required to simplify their production cues. At the theater, on the day of the concert, companies attend a brief production meeting with our staff and then have 10-20 minutes (time is assigned by our staff) to space dances. Companies also have 15-20 minutes of shared stage space immediately before the concert begins. We start at 10am on Saturday morning.</p>
	<br>

	<h5 style="margin-bottom: 1rem; text-align: center;">APPLICATION FAQS</h5>
	<p><strong>How do you select the works?</strong><br>
	A panel of curators from across the country views applications and makes selection recommendations to a team of artistic directors and production staff. This team makes final curatorial decisions based on the adjudicators’ comments and on the festival’s overall programming needs. We also consider our time/space parameters, number of dancers, tone, and even where the company is based, when making final programming decisions. Our goal is to curate a festival of dance that is diverse, compelling, entertaining, and of the highest possible artistic quality.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Can I submit more than one piece?</strong>
	<br>
	Yes, you may submit two pieces, but because your applications will go to different panelists, you must repeat the entire application process for the additional dance. Two dances? Two applications and two payments.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>What type of work are you looking for?</strong>
	<br>
	Austin Dance Festival presents modern/contemporary dance.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Can I specifically request to perform at a particular show?</strong>
	<br>
	No. By applying to the festival, you agree to perform in either of the two shows.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Can my video submission be a rehearsal video? Does it have to be of the dance I will be performing?</strong><br>
	Please submit a performance or rehearsal video of the dance you want to perform at the festival.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>How will I know if I’ve been selected?</strong>
	<br>
	All applicants will receive an email notification about the status of your submission(s). Please check your spam folders! If you are selected, you will be asked to promptly accept our invitation and send a professional photo for ADF marketing materials. If you do not meet our acceptance deadline, we will give your spot to another artist. Artists who are not selected this year are strongly encouraged to apply again next year.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Why wasn’t I selected?</strong>
	<br>
	Not being selected is not a commentary on the value of your work. It is unfortunate that space and time prevent us from accepting every submission. When making programming decisions, we consider a variety of factors including the tone of the dance, the length of the dance, the number of dancers, and even where the company is based. We also work within a very precise and limited amount of time and space, so it’s like working a puzzle as we try to “fit” dances together for a concert. We do not provide feedback to applicants who are not selected. If you are not selected this year, please consider applying again and give us another opportunity to show your work.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Do participants receive a stipend?</strong>
	<br>
	Austin-based artists and artists within a 60 mile radius of Austin will receive a $100 stipend. Texas-based artists (further than 60 miles from Austin) will receive a $200 stipend. Artists traveling from out of state will receive a $300 stipend. Artists traveling from abroad will receive a $400 stipend. You should be prepared to cover all remaining costs to attend the festival, including, but not limited to, food, parking, lodging, and transportation.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>I’ve read through the guidelines and FAQs, and I still have a question!</strong>
